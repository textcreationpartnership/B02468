            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The AUTHOR's Neceſſary Advertiſements FOR The better Uſe of the enſuing MEDITATIONS.</head>
            <p>THere are many People already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in Prayer, who cannot away with long Meditations. Som, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not time enough to read them. Others, becauſe they have not a Memory good enough to retain them. Beſides, their Underſtanding ſeeing that ready made, which it was to have wrought out, and finding without difficulty, what it was to have ſearched out by its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe becoms ſlack and negligent, and does ordinarily wander away in thoſe vaſt Regions, which are diſcovered to it. Whereas having but a little matter to meditate upon, it retains it without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<pb facs="tcp:175617:4"/>it reliſhes it with Pleaſure; becauſe every Workman loves his own Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, which has coſt him ſo much pains to make.</p>
            <p>A Hunter, who has been a long time in queſt of his Game, finds much joy when he has diſcovered it. The diſcovery of a Truth, makes a greater impreſſion upon the Soul, that finds it, than a hundred that are propoſed to her.</p>
            <p>She acknowledges better the effect of the favour, when being in a barren and waterleſs <hi>Deſart,</hi> ſhe ſees a <hi>Heavenly Manna</hi> fall down from Heaven for to feed her, and Waters break forth in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance out of the boſom of Rocks for the quenching of her Thirſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is like unto <hi>a grain of Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> which is very ſmall; but when it is beaten and pounded, it warms the Stomach.</p>
            <p>We muſt not load our Mind with too much Matter, no more than our Stomach with too much Meat: otherwiſe, it will not be able to diſgeſt it. For that reaſon, St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that great Man of Prayer, in his Book of Exerciſes, gave us very ſhort Meditations. And the more one advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:175617:4"/>the leſs matter he gives; to the end that the Soul may put her Confidence in God, and may beg Lights of him, apply her own Powers, expect his Succour, and ſenſibly acknowledge what ſhe has from her ſelf, for her Humiliation thereby: and what ſhe receives from God, that ſhe may thank him for it.</p>
            <p>There is a great difference between a <hi>Lecture</hi> and a <hi>Meditation.</hi> He who reads a good Book, ought to underſtand what he reads without pain, and without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Truth ought to preſent it ſelf to his Underſtanding, without his being obliged to ſearch after it. But he who meditates, muſt by his reaſoning dig in the <hi>Evangelical Field,</hi> that he may find the <hi>Treaſure of Grace</hi> that lies hid therein. 'Tis true that all the World are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of buſying themſelves, and framing Diſcourſes. And indeed, that very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has obliged ſom very Learned Men of our Time to Publiſh long Meditations, wherein Truths are propounded in all their force, and in all their extent, that thoſe who have not ſuch penetrating Wits, might help themſelves by their Reading, and have nothing more to do in their
<pb facs="tcp:175617:5"/>Prayer, but to have an affection for what they Read. But thoſe who have their Wit quick, active, curious, earneſt, and ſolid, require much Matter to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with, and are like unto Fire, which goes out when it has no more Fewel.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that it is a hard matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent all the World, yet I dare be ſo bold as to promiſe my ſelf, that both the one and the other, will be fitted with the Meditations, which I preſent them. Thoſe who deſire but a little Matter, will find in one only Line employment enough for a long time. Thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a great deal, by paſſing from one line to another, will rather want time, than matter for their entertainment.</p>
            <p>Learned Perſons will without difficulty find out, that moſt part of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of which theſe Meditations are made up, are Sentences of the Holy Fathers, tranſlated word for word into our Language. I was once in the mind to have quoted them in the Margent. But having conſidered, that ſuch like Citations are only for Books of Doctrin, and that R.F. <hi>Pontus</hi> has not made them in his Meditations: I thought I might
<pb facs="tcp:175617:5"/>diſpenſe with my ſelf therein. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Paſſages out of the Holy Fathers, I have ſet down ſom out of the Scripture for the maintenance of the Truths, which are in theſe Meditations, and for to give them, as I may ſay, a little ſeaſoning: for the <hi>words</hi> of Men are <hi>flat and inſipid,</hi> without the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>Word of God:</hi> nor do they make that impreſſion in Hearts, as the Sacred Text is wont to do, whoſe Weight and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity do perſuade mens Minds more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly, than all human Ratiocinations. Thus thoſe who have a Mind to act by Faith may ſtop upon the Scripture Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages: thoſe who have a mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe may take the matter of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.</p>
            <p>There are Meditations upon almoſt all Virtues, and upon all Vices, as alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Myſteries of our Lord, and of our Lady. And becauſe the ſenſe of theſe Truths is to be included in one or two lines, it was neceſſary to make theſe Meditations in form of Sentences, and little Verſes, for to give them a more pleaſing Cadence, without mingling any Rhimes, which I broke off as much as I could poſſible.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:175617:6"/>
            <p>I confeſs you will find ſom Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein. But is there any Book of Meditations wherein there are none? And is it poſſible to handle ſo many Matters ſo like, without falling into the ſame thoughts? Moreover, I affirm, That it is good to meditate the ſame things three or four times over. For a Truth that doth not touch you at one time, does often touch you at another; as S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> takes notice. And for that reaſon, I volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily left ſome Repetitions therein, which I might have changed.</p>
            <p>As for the order of the Meditations, it is conformable to that of the three States of a Spiritual Life, to wit, <hi>Of Beginners: Proficients,</hi> and <hi>Perfect:</hi> that every one may without difficulty find Matters conformable to their Diſpoſition. 'Tis the Method that F. <hi>Ponte</hi> makes uſe of, which I thought fit to follow.</p>
            <p>But for to content thoſe who deſire to have different Matter for all the year long: I have made a Table, which marks out to them for every Day the ſubject of their Meditation.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas it is not poſſible to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh different Matters of this Nature for
<pb facs="tcp:175617:6"/>a whole year, and becauſe theſe Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are filled with ſo great a number of Truths, that each one of them is ſufficient to take up ſeveral days: I was forced twice or thrice in the year to give the ſame ſubject to meditate on, leaving it to every one's Devotion to change his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, when that, which he meets with, pleaſes him not.</p>
            <p>I have for every day propoſed the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the moſt conformable to the Goſpel of the <hi>Sunday.</hi> Wherefore you would do well to Read it, in the beginning of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Week. The ſame thing I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerved on the Feaſts of the Saints: for I give Meditations either on the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which they practiſed, or on the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that is Read on their Maſs. Thoſe who ſhall Read the Abridgment of their Life, may eaſily joyn their Example to the Truth, which they meditate on.</p>
            <p>There are ſome virtuous Perſons, who deſire every Month to make the Exerciſe of Death: and for to ſatisfie their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have at the end of every Month put four Meditations for to prepare them thereunto. Thoſe, whom this Devotion does not pleaſe, may make uſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:175617:7"/>others that are there marked out for them, or chooſe thoſe they have a mind to in the firſt Table, that follows. Now, for to make profit of theſe Meditations, this, I conceive, is the Method, they are to be made in.</p>
            <p>After the ordinary Preparations, of which we have ſpoken in our Method of Prayer, Read with reſpect and attention the words of the Holy Scripture: Weigh each word of them: Make Acts of Faith: and if you find your Mind to be taken up, ſtop there without going any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But, in caſe it fix not upon that ſubject: Read then the firſt part of your Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtop at that <hi>Truth,</hi> which makes moſt impreſſion on your Heart: or elſe begin by the two firſt lines. Endeavour to penetrate the ſence of them. Make reflexion on your ſelf, and ſee whether your life be conformable to thoſe <hi>Truths.</hi> Conceive a Sorrow, and conſequently made good Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>For example, if you meditate upon <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> and that you be com to theſe two lines, <hi>All that I endure is nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Puniſhment that I have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:175617:7"/>Call to mind for a while the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Sins of your life: compare the place that you are in, with that which you ought to be in: the pains that you ſuffer, with thoſe that you ought to have ſuffered. Meaſure the time of your pains, with that of Eternity, and ſee whether you have reaſon to complain. Say, <hi>If God had don with me according to his juſtice, where ſhould I now have been? Am not I better here than in Hell? If I were there, as ſo many others are, would not I reckon my ſelf happy to com out from thence for to endure, what I now endure? Why then ſhould I complain? Does God do me wrong? Have not I deſerved infinitly much more?</hi> Puſh on this Conſideration, and preſs your heart until it ſubmits it ſelf to God's Orders.</p>
            <p>Conſequently frame your affections: give thanks to our Lord for his Goodneſs and Mercy that he has uſed towards you. Beg Pardon of him for your Impatiences, and make reſolutions of ſuffering, better than you hitherto have.</p>
            <p>Then you ſhall paſs on to the following line. <hi>In compariſon of the Glory that is prepared for me.</hi> And you ſhall meditate
<pb facs="tcp:175617:8"/>on it, as on the foregoing lines: Thus flying up and down like a <hi>Bee</hi> from flower to flower, until you have found the honey of Devotion.</p>
            <p>But in caſe nothing do touch you: yet quit not your Prayer for all that: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main quiet in the Preſence of God: or elſe make uſe of the Practices that we have taught you in the <hi>Method of Prayer.</hi> You may alſo Read the words of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are at the end of the Fourth Part; and there doubtleſs you will find ſom comfort.</p>
            <p>When at any time you find your ſelf in any extraordinary diſpoſition of Joy, or Sadneſs: it will be good, even out of Prayer to entertain your ſelf in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Lift up your heart to God: beg of him to make known to you his Divine Will and Pleaſure. Then opening your Book, ſtop at that Meditation on which you have lighted, and you will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find therein, what you ſeek after. The Providence of God, ſays the Wiſe man, plays upon Earth with Men, and takes delight to manifeſt it ſelf in caſual, and unforethought-of accidents.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:175617:8"/>
            <p>Since I am commanded to put my Name to this new Edition, I conjure all virtuous Perſons, through the Charity which they owe to thoſe who are in miſery, to give ſom place in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to him, and ſom ſhare in their Prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here follow two Tables: the Firſt, of the Meditations of the two Tomes. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of thoſe which are to ſerve for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day in the Year.</hi>

                  <p>O JESUS! Give me my bread this day. Strengthen me with your graces, that I may compaſs the great journy of Eternity, and that I may perſever to the end. Without this bread I ſhall faint, and ſhall never be able to get to Heaven.</p>

                  <p>Lord, the number of my ſins is infinit. If you keep an account of our iniquities, alas! who will be able to ſubſiſt?

                  <p>You have promiſed to forgive him that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives: to ſhew mercy to him that ſhows it.

                  <p>Now it is, O my God, that I ſtand in need of your protection, and your aſſiſtance. See how all my enemies ſurround me on all ſides. The roaring Lyon is com out of Hell for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me: But if you are with me, what need I fear? Although I ſhould walk in the midſt of the ſhadow of death, I ſhall apprehend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, being in your company. Although I

Although all the Devils of Hell were ready to enter into combat againſt me, I would not tremble, ſince you are with me, and that you make me hope, that I ſhall have your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Ariſe then, O God of Hoſts, com quickly to my ſuccour. Send St. <hi>Michael</hi> with his Troops, to relieve me. You know my weakneſs: there is none greater in the World.

I accept of all the reſt, that you ſhall think fit to ſend me. I am ready to go to Purgatory for to ſatisfie your Juſtice. But, O God of mercy, I conjure you by the pretious blood of your Son, and for the love that his holy Mother bore him, ſend me not into Hell, where no body praiſes you, nor loves you. Call me to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where I ſhall ſee you, where I ſhall love you, where I ſhall praiſe you for all Eternity. <hi>Amen.</hi> So be it.</p>

                     <l>Which makes a God to cry out?</l>

                     <l>Which he makes a little before he dies?</l>
                     <l>Which gives occaſion to thoſe that hear him complain,</l>
                     <l>To doubt whether he were the true Son of God,</l>

And who didſt ſtrip thy ſelf of thy farce, for to cloath thy ſelf with my Infirmities. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adore thee, all bathed in thy blood.
